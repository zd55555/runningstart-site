        <p>Tools change every six months. The skill of knowing whether to trust what a tool tells you doesn't change at all.</p>

        <p>That's what I mean by durable skills. Not "soft skills" (a term that makes them sound optional). Not "21st century skills" (we're a quarter of the way through the century, we can stop calling them that). The thinking habits that matter regardless of which platform, app, or AI model is popular this week.</p>

        <h2 class="article-heading">Why this, why now</h2>

        <p>Most people's understanding of how information works is frozen at whatever moment they last paid attention. For many educated adults, that moment was early 2023 for AI, roughly 2010 for media literacy, and never for how social media algorithms shape their worldview.</p>

        <p>This isn't a stupidity problem. It's a timing problem. People formed reasonable conclusions based on what they saw, then stopped looking. The teacher who tried ChatGPT in early 2023, watched it hallucinate, and decided AI wasn't for serious work? That was a reasonable conclusion at the time. It's outdated now. The architecture has changed. The tools have changed. But the mental model is still sitting right where it was.</p>

        <p>I call this the frozen mental model problem. And it's everywhere. Not because people are incurious, but because life moves fast and nobody sent a memo saying "hey, the thing you dismissed two years ago works differently now."</p>

        <h2 class="article-heading">What's actually durable</h2>

        <p>Here's the thing. We've had four distinct eras of finding information in the last fifty years. Card catalogs. Digital catalogs. Search engines. And now AI that synthesizes answers from sources. Each era changed the mechanics. None of them changed the core question: can I trust what I'm looking at?</p>

        <p>That question is the durable skill. The ability to evaluate whether information is reliable, regardless of where it came from or what tool surfaced it. We used to call this information literacy. The name still works. It's bigger than AI literacy, which sounds like it has an expiration date. Information literacy is the container that holds all of it: evaluating sources, understanding how AI generates and grounds its outputs, recognizing when algorithms are shaping what you see, and building your own reliable knowledge base.</p>

        <h2 class="article-heading">Where we're starting</h2>

        <p>Information literacy is the first topic on this site because it's the one that connects everything else. It breaks into four areas:</p>

        <div class="topic-grid">
            <div class="topic-card">
                <h3>Media Literacy</h3>
                <p>Evaluating sources, understanding bias, knowing how information gets produced and distributed. The foundation that predates AI by decades.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="topic-card">
                <h3>AI-Generated Content</h3>
                <p>The difference between grounded and ungrounded AI output. When to trust it, when to verify, and what changed since 2023.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="topic-card">
                <h3>Algorithms and Attention</h3>
                <p>How platforms shape what you see. Not a scolding about social media. Context for why mental models freeze in the first place.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="topic-card">
                <h3>Knowledge Capture</h3>
                <p>Building your own reliable knowledge base instead of trusting whatever floats by. Still forming this one.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <p>These four aren't separate subjects. They're layers of the same problem. A person scrolling social media (algorithms and attention) encounters an AI-generated article (AI content) that cites a real-looking source (media literacy) and has no system for checking it later (knowledge capture). The failure point could be any of the four. The skill of catching it is one skill with four expressions.</p>

        <h2 class="article-heading">Who this is for</h2>

        <p>I'm building this for adult educators and instructors. Teachers in workforce development, healthcare training, adult basic education. People who teach other adults for a living and need to help those adults make good decisions with information.</p>

        <p>Most of them are curious about AI but hesitant. Many tried ChatGPT once, formed an opinion, stopped. They know how to use Google competently. They understand basic source evaluation. What they haven't seen is how the AI architecture has changed since 2023, that free tools now exist with verifiable citations, or how much of their information environment is shaped by algorithmic feeds rather than anything they chose to read.</p>

        <p>The goal isn't to sell them on AI. It's to create a moment of recognition: "oh, my understanding of this is outdated." Not by telling people they're wrong, but by showing them something they didn't know existed. Additive, not corrective.</p>

        <h2 class="article-heading">What comes next</h2>

        <p>This page is the overview. Over time, each of those four areas will get its own deeper treatment with demonstrations, interactive tools, and practical resources. The information literacy framing came first because it's where the gap is widest and the stakes are most immediate.</p>

        <p>I'm an instructional designer. I'm on this path myself, figuring it out as I go and building the things I wish existed. If that sounds useful, stick around.</p>
