        <p>Until recently, using a computer was a discrete event. You sat down, did a thing, walked away. That's not what's happening now. We're shifting toward persistent collaboration with systems that think alongside us, and that changes everything about how we learn, work, and make decisions.</p>

        <h2 class="article-heading">What I wanted to understand</h2>
        <p>This project started with three threads I kept pulling on:</p>

        <p><strong>How we learn to learn with AI.</strong> Not just "how to use ChatGPT." How the presence of AI changes the learning process itself. What skills matter when your thinking partner has access to everything ever written.</p>

        <p><strong>How thinking extends beyond one brain.</strong> Cognition doesn't stop at your skull. It runs through tools, environments, other people. That's been true for a long time, but AI makes it more visible and more consequential.</p>

        <p><strong>How humans actually acquire and hold onto knowledge.</strong> The basics of learning science, attention, memory, cognitive load. These fundamentals don't change just because the tools got smarter. But how they play out is shifting fast.</p>

        <h2 class="article-heading">What I actually learned</h2>

        <p>A year later and I don't remember much about HCI as a topic. I built a 17-page research project covering distributed cognition, cybernetics, embodied cognition, cognitive load theory, brain-computer interfaces, futures studies. I organized it, designed it, iterated on it across multiple rounds using deep research tools. And if you asked me to explain cognitive ergonomics right now, I'd have to go look it up.</p>

        <p>But I learned how to do deep research with AI, how to structure and present complex information, how to build something from nothing across rounds of reading and rebuilding. I can use the graphing calculator. I just don't remember how to plot a line by hand.</p>

        <figure class="article-figure-inline">
            <img src="images/bci.jpg" alt="Brain-computer interface visualization" loading="lazy">
        </figure>

        <p>That gap is the lesson. One of the topics I studied was cognitive offloading, the idea that we use tools to hold knowledge so our brains don't have to. I didn't just read about it. I lived it. I offloaded seventeen pages of research to a system, got good at the process of working with that system, and moved on to the next thing. Work, kids, a dozen other AI developments pulling my attention. The knowledge is still there in the project. It's just not in my head.</p>

        <p>And that is HCI. That's the actual human-computer interaction story, not the theory, but the lived version. We're building with tools that extend what we can do, and the question is what stays with us when we walk away from the screen. I don't have a clean answer. But the question itself shaped how I think about everything on this site.</p>

        <h2 class="article-heading">Go deeper</h2>
        <p>To learn about HCI, I used Gamma to create a 17-page research project, forcing myself to organize and explain concepts. The point was never to publish. It was to explore the topic and test Gamma as a tool.</p>
