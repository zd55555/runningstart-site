    <h1 class="article-title">How We Think With Machines</h1>

    <div class="article-body">

        <h2 class="article-heading">Why this matters here</h2>
        <p>Everything on this site traces back to one question: what happens when thinking becomes a collaboration between humans and machines? Not AI replacing us. Not us using AI as a fancy tool. Something in between, where the line between your cognition and the system's gets blurry. That shift is already reshaping how kids learn, how adults work, and what skills matter. To think clearly about any of it, I needed a framework. So I built one.</p>

        <h2 class="article-heading">How I learned this</h2>
        <p>In spring 2025, I went deep on human-computer interaction, cognitive science, and AI collaboration models. I read papers, mapped frameworks, and synthesized across disciplines: learning science, cybernetics, embodied cognition, futures studies, ethics.</p>
        <p>The meta move: I learned HCI by building a site about HCI. I used Gamma to create a 17-page research project, forcing myself to organize and explain concepts until they stuck. The site is unfinished. The point was never to publish. It was to get this into my own head.</p>

        <h2 class="article-heading">What stuck</h2>
        <p>A few things changed how I think:</p>

        <ul class="takeaways">
            <li>
                <strong>Cognition doesn't stop at your skull.</strong> It extends through tools, environments, and other people. This isn't metaphor. It's how expertise actually works.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Attention is the scarce resource, not information.</strong> Every design choice is a bet on what deserves focus. Most AI tools get this wrong.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Trust calibration is a skill.</strong> Knowing when to rely on AI and when to override it is learnable. Nobody's teaching it.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Language is the interface now.</strong> Prompting isn't a hack. It's a core literacy. The ability to externalize your thinking clearly determines what you get from these systems.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>We're co-evolving with our tools.</strong> The way you think shapes the AI. The AI shapes the way you think. This loop is accelerating.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>The full research project: <a class="link" href="https://thinking-with-machine-ah3elc6.gamma.site/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thinking With Machines</a></p>
        <p>It's unfinished and academic. But if you want the long version, it's there.</p>
