        <div class="post-body">
            <p>Of the millions of jobs that will be displaced by AI, the most at risk are low-paying administrative titles. These workers are more likely to have little savings, fewer transferable skills, and therefore limited opportunity to pivot.</p>
            <p>UBI and other safety nets are a long way off. We need to prioritize financial literacy in (re)training programs.</p>
            <p class="aside">[Here's the version I gave my nephew that actually stuck. Figure out two numbers: earnings vs. spending. Make sure the former is larger than the latter. Download an app like You Need A Budget (free year for students). And if you or someone you know is check to check, visit 211.org for free local resources.]</p>

        <div class="post-body">
            <p>The AI tradeoff: productivity up, knowledge down.</p>
            <p>I'm referring primarily to an overreliance on AI when doing research. Soon, we'll all have access to tools like ChatGPT's agents, which can conduct deep research and create presentations. How will a student (or employee) handle Q&A if they were barely involved in the research and development of the content?</p>
            <p>It will be tempting to delegate everything, but people need to be aware of the tradeoff. Emphasize it during AI literacy training when discussing other caveats and limitations (bias, hallucinations, data privacy, etc.)</p>

        <div class="post-body">
            <p>On "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?" contestants never asked for a help article. They wanted to phone a friend. That's where we're headed with 1-800-ChatGPT (yeah, that's real) and NotebookLM's podcast-style audio overview, which now allows you to jump into the conversation and ask questions.</p>
            <p>The latter is a step closer to what we'll want to see because it's grounded in the resources you upload - just as firms will connect to their knowledge base. Aside from the beauty of getting the exact answer you need, when you need it, consider the efficiency: Our typing rate vs. our speaking rate of 150+ words per minute.</p>
            <p>Many companies already offer solutions like this - it's just become much easier to create, host, update, etc. these types of tools now. And this all points to the question: Is the training even needed if quality, just-in-time information is so readily available?</p>

        <div class="post-body">
            <p>AI "Agents" are barely a thing and already need a rebrand. Actually, it's fitting that "real estate" or "CIA agent" comes to mind—it highlights both the potential benefits and risks.</p>
            <p>Microsoft's new AI "agents" are like a powerful, user-friendly upgrade to Power Automate. You'll see some polished use cases in the video, which aim to show a clearer path to ROI than their existing Copilot upgrade. Anthropic's latest release is a bigger leap, with the AI acting like a human clicking through websites to complete tasks - called robotic process automation (RPA). Imagine asking, "Buy me round trip tickets to Puerto Rico (no Spirit Airlines)," and it's done.</p>
            <p>Spoiler: It can't do that consistently. . . yet.</p>
            <p>Why can't the robot skip the clicking and just buy the tickets directly on the backend? While possible on some sites, the web isn't built for that. . . yet.</p>

        <div class="post-body">
            <p>No one actually taught you how to ride a bike, and no one is going to teach you how to use AI.</p>
            <p>Because no one can teach you how to balance on a bike (you need to feel it), and no one can teach you what AI can and can't do (you need to feel it).</p>
            <p>Someone did encourage you to ride the bike and gave you the basics (pedal, don't fall over).</p>
            <p>So, here's some encouragement and the basics for AI (use it, don't anthropomorphize it).</p>
            <p>Next steps:<br>
            ▪️ Subscribe to ChatGPT Plus: $20 (that's your bike)<br>
            ▪️ Try live voice with the phone app<br>
            ▪️ Use the new Canvas feature<br>
            ▪️ Switch to Preview 01 and challenge it with a STEM question<br>
            ▪️ Build your own custom GPT (you can do it!)</p>
            <p>Not sure how to do any of those steps? Ask ChatGPT. Use AI to learn AI.</p>

        <h2 class="post-title">I Made a Podcast With One Click</h2>
        <div class="post-body">
            <p>I hadn't planned on making a podcast about AI and the Future of Work, but here we are.</p>
            <p>With Google's NotebookLM, you upload files, and it will summarize, create study guides, FAQs - and now it can even generate podcasts.* I tested it with three files: the US Bureau of Labor Statistics' employment projections (Aug 2024), the International Monetary Fund's report on AI and the future of work (Jan 2024), and JFF's AI-Ready Workforce (Nov 2023).</p>
            <p>The result? A 19-minute podcast created with one click using the 'Dive Deep' feature. Just listen to the first few minutes to hear the conversational tone and how it pulled key points from the reports.</p>
            <p>This would be much more useful if it could be edited. I'd cut it down to 10 minutes, for example. Even in its current form, it's a great teaching tool. Students could read the source files and then evaluate the AI-generated podcast.</p>
            <p class="aside">*This is an example of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), where AI generates content by referencing specific documents you provide. Why use RAG? Usually chatbots like ChatGPT or Gemini generate responses from a massive general knowledge base. RAG, by contrast, ensures the output is more accurate and relevant by pulling only from the documents you upload. This makes it incredibly useful for research, where accuracy and staying true to the source is critical.</p>

        <h2 class="post-title">Returning With No AI Guidance</h2>
        <div class="post-body">
            <p>Returning for the 2024-2025 academic year with little to no guidance? A friend is facing this. After a week of PD, with no clear AI policies or training, the district has defaulted to an abstinence-only policy. Risky.</p>
            <p>If you're in a similar situation and not sure where to start:</p>
            <p>1. Give students guidance. Saying, "Don't use AI" is not realistic. They are already using it. You'll just get shadow use, and AI detection tools are inconsistent at best.</p>
            <p>2. Encourage transparency:<br>
            a) Require citations (<a class="link" href="https://lnkd.in/gDdGZj63" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MLA's AI guide</a>)<br>
            b) Consider a "show your work" approach, similar to how math instruction adapted to calculators. For example, if you allow them to brainstorm using ChatGPT as part of the writing process, students could provide screenshots of (or links to) the chatbot conversation.</p>
