        <div class="post-body">
            <p>Of the millions of jobs that will be displaced by AI, the most at risk are low-paying administrative titles. These workers are more likely to have little savings, fewer transferable skills, and therefore limited opportunity to pivot.</p>
            <p>UBI and other safety nets are a long way off. We need to prioritize financial literacy in (re)training programs.</p>
            <p class="aside">[Here's the version I gave my nephew that actually stuck. Figure out two numbers: earnings vs. spending. Make sure the former is larger than the latter. Download an app like You Need A Budget (free year for students). And if you or someone you know is check to check, visit 211.org for free local resources.]</p>

        <h2 class="post-title">The AI Tradeoff</h2>
        <div class="post-body">
            <p>The AI tradeoff: productivity up, knowledge down.</p>
            <p>I'm referring primarily to an overreliance on AI when doing research. Soon, we'll all have access to tools like ChatGPT's agents, which can conduct deep research and create presentations. How will a student (or employee) handle Q&A if they were barely involved in the research and development of the content?</p>
            <p>It will be tempting to delegate everything, but people need to be aware of the tradeoff. Emphasize it during AI literacy training when discussing other caveats and limitations (bias, hallucinations, data privacy, etc.)</p>

        <h2 class="post-title">No One Taught You How to Ride a Bike</h2>
        <div class="post-body">
            <p>No one actually taught you how to ride a bike, and no one is going to teach you how to use AI.</p>
            <p>Because no one can teach you how to balance on a bike (you need to feel it), and no one can teach you what AI can and can't do (you need to feel it).</p>
            <p>Someone did encourage you to ride the bike and gave you the basics (pedal, don't fall over).</p>
            <p>So, here's some encouragement and the basics for AI (use it, don't anthropomorphize it).</p>
            <p>Next steps:<br>
            ▪️ Subscribe to ChatGPT Plus: $20 (that's your bike)<br>
            ▪️ Try live voice with the phone app<br>
            ▪️ Use the new Canvas feature<br>
            ▪️ Switch to Preview 01 and challenge it with a STEM question<br>
            ▪️ Build your own custom GPT (you can do it!)</p>
            <p>Not sure how to do any of those steps? Ask ChatGPT. Use AI to learn AI.</p>
