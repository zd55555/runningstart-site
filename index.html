        <div class="post-body">
            <p>Of the millions of jobs that will be displaced by AI, the most at risk are low-paying administrative titles. These workers are more likely to have little savings, fewer transferable skills, and therefore limited opportunity to pivot.</p>
            <p>UBI and other safety nets are a long way off. We need to prioritize financial literacy in (re)training programs.</p>
            <p class="aside">[Here's the version I gave my nephew that actually stuck. Figure out two numbers: earnings vs. spending. Make sure the former is larger than the latter. Download an app like You Need A Budget (free year for students). And if you or someone you know is check to check, visit 211.org for free local resources.]</p>

        <h2 class="post-title">The AI Tradeoff</h2>
        <div class="post-body">
            <p>The AI tradeoff: productivity up, knowledge down.</p>
            <p>I'm referring primarily to an overreliance on AI when doing research. Soon, we'll all have access to tools like ChatGPT's agents, which can conduct deep research and create presentations. How will a student (or employee) handle Q&A if they were barely involved in the research and development of the content?</p>
            <p>It will be tempting to delegate everything, but people need to be aware of the tradeoff. Emphasize it during AI literacy training when discussing other caveats and limitations (bias, hallucinations, data privacy, etc.)</p>
