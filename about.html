        <p>I think about AI constantly. Not because it's trendy. Because I have kids who'll grow up in whatever world this technology creates, and I work with adults whose jobs and livelihoods depend on adapting to it. The stakes aren't abstract for me. They're personal.</p>

        <p>I studied history to understand how we got here. I studied international relations to understand what's happening now. And I'm studying our relationship with technology to understand what might be coming. Each degree gave me a different lens. History taught me that humans are bad at predicting consequences. International relations taught me that access and power aren't distributed evenly. Instructional design taught me that how people learn matters as much as what they learn.</p>

        <p>Those three lenses keep converging on the same point: AI is the most consequential technology humans have ever created, and the people who need it most are the ones least likely to get access to it.</p>

        <p>I'm not an AI evangelist. I'm an instructional designer who noticed that information literacy is the actual gap. Most people don't need more AI hype. They need someone to explain what's real, what's speculative, and what they can do about it today. I'm trying to be that person, while being honest that I'm figuring it out alongside everyone else.</p>

        <p>Before all of this, I did development work in Liberia. That experience shaped how I think about access, about who gets left behind, and about the distance between good intentions and useful outcomes.</p>

        <p>This site is where I work things out in public. I'm building the resources I wish existed for people trying to understand AI without the hype, the jargon, or the sales pitch. If you're an educator, a trainer, a parent, or someone who works with people and wants to understand what this technology means for them, this is for you.</p>

        <p>I'm on the same path you are. I don't have the answers. But I'm paying attention, and I'm building things along the way. You can find me on <a class="link" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/conzolo-migliozzi-152b30b/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LinkedIn</a>.</p>
